# Filtering the promoter BAM files
  # Maximum length
    # reads should be chr20:4685060--4688047 = 2988 bp
    # allowing some extra length for adapter/barcode >> say maximum 3500 bp
    # Why care? Longer reads should not be possible and so are suspicious
      # see eg. https://community.nanoporetech.com/posts/a-quick-guide-to-tiling-am, below Barcode mismatches

  # Minimum length
    # this can be slightly more flexible
    # say minimum 1000 bp

  # Soft-clipping
    #Â from looking at some reads in IGV, soft-clipping is typically can up to ~ 200 bp on each side and read still look good
    # i.e. 400 bp / 2988 bp = 13%
    # longer is potentially suspicious
    # say maximum 15%

  # Keep only primary alignments
    # should guarantee that read IDs are unique
