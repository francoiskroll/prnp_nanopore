# filter reads in a BAM file

# currently handles
  # minimum Phred score
  # minimum reference span (previously read length)
    # Note; reference span is basically read length as you see it in IGV, i.e. how much of the reference it covers
    # it includes deletions/insertions and soft-clipped
    # e.g. read has 150 bp aligned + 10 bp deletion + 20 bp soft-clipped, reference span is 150 + 10 + 20 = 180 bp
    # however, if we were looking at its length (as in number of characters), it would be 150 + 20 = 170 bp, so doing so has the risk to bias against deletions
  # maximum read length (not currently in this version, see in v1 if need to add it back)
  # maximum proportion soft-clipped
  # only primary alignments (or all)

# explanation
  # filterBAM.command -i XXX.bam -e int -f int -s float -p (yes or no) -o XXX.bam
    # -i = input = bam file to process
    # -e = PhrEd score = minimum Phred score
    # -f = floor = minimum read span
    # -s = maximum proportion Soft-clipped
    # -o = output = name of bam file to output

# example
  #Â  filterBam.command -i F08.bam -e 40 -f 149 -s 0.2 -p no -o clean.bam

# v2: relies more heavily on R script readsToThrow.R to name the reads to remove
# easier as can edit there if want to add filters
